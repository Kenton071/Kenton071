Kenton071/Kenton071 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes. As a Disclaimer, my code is usually written extremely clumsily leading to problems with formatting and stylistic issues (code that is hard to read), so I use AI to format it to make it easier to digest.
